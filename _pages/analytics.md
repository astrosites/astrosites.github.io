It can be useful to see what traffic you're getting on your site. You can use Google Analytics to do this.

[Get Started with Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en)

1. Create a Google Analytics account.

2. Click Admin at the bottom left of the page (gear icon), then click 'Create Property'. Enter the name of your website in the Property Name field (e.g., Personal Website). Click Next, then complete the creation of the property.

3. Choose Web Platform. When prompted, enter the URL of the website (e.g., myname.github.io). Click Create Stream.

4. In the Tagging Instructions section, look under 'Add new on-page tag'. Click the drop-down for Global site tag. Copy the text into the <head> section of your HTML.

5. Now you should be able to see your website and traffic stats under All Web Site Data.
